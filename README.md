# Reason for the project: 
   This project was built in order to apply and showcase the skills we have learned and developed during our phase three training at the Software Engineering Live class - FlatIron Bootcamp (class of 09/21). These skills major in our use of JavaScript and React to manipulate and change the DOM, and also the use of HTML and CSS to develop and design webpages. To create a backend API for our application, we utilized Ruby on Rails to create CRUD responses, Activerecord to make SQL commands, and Ruby to create classes and endpoints.

# Project Description: 
    Budget Buddy was created to assist Users with budgeting their monthly income. You can create an account and sign in. The app allows you to add you budgets and does the calculations for you. While inputing values into the forms, your expenses will be added and subtracted from your monthly income. There are validations where if your expenses are larger than your monthly income, you will not be able to submit. Also, you can view all budgets and edit them. Clicking the show details button will show you all your expenses, remaining money, and a doughnut graph of expenses.


# Learnings and Struggles:
    While creating this app, I got a better understanding of sessions. Also, since this project was a solo one, I was forced to learn more about flex boxes in CSS. I also struggled with CSS.
  
# Acknowledgments:
    I used numerous resources both from our curriculum and those available for free online. These allowed us to expand our knowledge and practice many new skills.
