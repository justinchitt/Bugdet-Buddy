# Reason for the project: 
   This project was built in order to apply and showcase the skills we have learned and developed during our phase three training at the Software Engineering Live class - FlatIron Bootcamp (class of 09/21). These skills major in our use of JavaScript and React to manipulate and change the DOM, and also the use of HTML and CSS to develop and design webpages. To create a backend API for our application, we utilized Ruby on Rails to create CRUD responses, Activerecord to make SQL commands, and Ruby to create classes and endpoints.
